            <h1>A Lover's Complaint</h1>
            <p><em>By William Shakespeare</em></p>
          
            <p>
              From off a hill whose concave womb re-worded<br>
              A plaintful story from a sistering vale,<br>
              My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,<br>
              And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;<br>
              Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,<br>
              Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,<br>
              Storming her world with sorrow’s wind and rain.<br><br>
          
              Upon her head a platted hive of straw,<br>
              Which fortified her visage from the sun,<br>
              Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw<br>
              The carcass of a beauty spent and done:<br>
              Time had not scythed all that youth begun,<br>
              Nor youth all quit; but, spite of Heaven's fell rage,<br>
              Some beauty peeped through lattice of sear'd age.<br><br>
          
              Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,<br>
              Which on it had conceited characters,<br>
              Laundering the silken figures in the brine<br>
              That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,<br>
              And often reading what content it bears;<br>
              As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,<br>
              In clamours of all size, both high and low.<br><br>
          
              ‘His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;<br>
              And every light occasion of the wind<br>
              Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.<br>
              What’s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:<br>
              Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,<br>
              For on his visage was in little drawn<br>
              What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.<br><br>
          
              ‘Small show of man was yet upon his chin;<br>
              His phoenix down began but to appear,<br>
              Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,<br>
              Whose bare out-bragg’d the web it seem’d to wear:<br>
              Yet show’d his visage by that cost more dear;<br>
              And nice affections wavering stood in doubt<br>
              If best were as it was, or best without.<br><br>
          
              ‘His qualities were beauteous as his form,<br>
              For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;<br>
              Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm<br>
              As oft ’twixt May and April is to see,<br>
              When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.<br>
              His rudeness so with his authorized youth<br>
              Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.<br><br>
          
              ‘Well could he ride, and often men would say<br>
              “That horse his mettle from his rider takes:<br>
              Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,<br>
              What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!”<br>
              And controversy hence a question takes,<br>
              Whether the horse by him became his deed,<br>
              Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.<br><br>
          
              ‘But quickly on this side the verdict went:<br>
              His real habitude gave life and grace<br>
              To appertainings and to ornament,<br>
              Accomplished in himself, not in his case:<br>
              All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,<br>
              Came for additions; yet their purposed trim<br>
              Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.<br><br>
          
              ‘So on the tip of his subduing tongue<br>
              All kind of arguments and question deep,<br>
              All replication prompt, and reason strong,<br>
              For his advantage still did wake and sleep:<br>
              To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,<br>
              He had the dialect and different skill,<br>
              Catching all passions in his craft of will;<br><br>
          
              ‘That he did in the general bosom reign<br>
              Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,<br>
              To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain<br>
              In personal duty, following where he haunted:<br>
              Consents bewitch’d, ere he desire, have granted;<br>
              And dialogued for him what he would say,<br>
              Ask’d their own wills, and made their wills obey.<br><br>
          
              ‘Many there were that did his picture get,<br>
              To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;<br>
              Like fools that in the imagination set<br>
              The goodly objects which abroad they find<br>
              Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign’d;<br>
              And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them<br>
              Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:<br><br>
          
              ‘So many have, that never touch’d his hand,<br>
              Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.<br>
              My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,<br>
              And was my own fee-simple, not in part,<br>
              What with his art in youth, and youth in art,<br>
              Threw my affections in his charmed power,<br>
              Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.<br><br>
          
              ‘Yet did I not, as some my equals did,<br>
              Demand of him, nor, being desired, yielded;<br>
              Finding myself in honour so forbid,<br>
              With safest distance I mine honour shielded:<br>
              Experience for me many bulwarks builded<br>
              Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain’d the foil<br>
              Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.<br><br>
          
              ‘But, ah, who ever shunn’d by precedent<br>
              The destined ill she must herself assay?<br>
              Or forced examples, ’gainst her own content,<br>
              To put the by-past perils in her way?<br>
              Counsel may stop a while what will not stay;<br>
              For when we rage, advice is often seen<br>
              By blunting us to make our wits more keen.<br><br>
