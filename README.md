# 4 Wings of Computer Science

This is a silly little idea i had for my **Final Project for CS50X!!** 
Here i demonstrate "4 Wings":
  - **Innovation** (demontrating the usage of Computer Science for innovations like Sign Language AI Models)
  - **Entertainment** (demonstrating the usage of Computer Science for the Entertainment industry)
  - **Intelligence** (demonstrating the usage of Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence like Large Language AI Models)
  - **Your Turn** (Your Turn)

The point of this is to show off the different usages for Computer Science, kinda like an Etude for programming ;]
