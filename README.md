# Four Wings  

Four Wings is a web-based application that demonstrates the versatility of computer science by highlighting its four key pillars: **Innovation**, **Wishes**, **Intelligence**, and **Your Turn**. Each "wing" represents a unique aspect of how computer science can impact and improve the world. This project was built as part of my final submission for CS50x and showcases the skills I acquired during the course.  

The website leverages Flask as its framework, combined with advanced APIs and frontend technologies like JavaScript and CSS, to create an engaging, aesthetic, and interactive experience. Below is an in-depth look at each wing and the technologies that power them.

## The Four Wings  

### 1. Innovation  
The first wing, **Innovation**, demonstrates how computer science can be used to create groundbreaking tools that solve real-world problems.  

- **Feature**:  
  This section uses your device's camera to track and log the three-dimensional positions of your joints using advanced computer vision techniques. It visually maps joint landmarks, providing a glimpse of how such innovations can serve practical purposes, such as building sign language tools for the disabled.  

- **Purpose**:  
  To highlight the potential of computer science in creating innovative solutions for people with disabilities.

### 2. Wishes  
The second wing, **Wishes**, illustrates how computer science can help make dreams a reality.  

- **Feature**:  
  Users can input a wish, and the application provides a detailed path for achieving it. This is achieved by integrating the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API. The AI is programmed to generate actionable steps tailored to the user's input.  

- **Purpose**:  
  To inspire users by showing how technology can assist in planning and achieving personal goals and aspirations.

### 3. Intelligence  
The third wing, **Intelligence**, showcases the ability of computer science to simplify and interpret complex ideas.  

- **Feature**:  
  A William Shakespeare poem is presented on the page. Users can highlight any text, and the application will provide a detailed explanation of the selected lines. This is achieved by calling the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API through a Flask backend.  

- **Purpose**:  
  To demonstrate how computer science can enhance education and understanding by breaking down complex texts into simpler explanations.

### 4. Your Turn  
The fourth wing, **Your Turn**, is a call to action for users to embark on their own journey into computer science.  

- **Feature**:  
  This section provides a link to CS50x's official website, encouraging users to begin learning computer science for themselves. Animations and interactive elements enhance the experience, making it engaging and inspiring.  

- **Purpose**:  
  To motivate users to take the first step in learning computer science and discovering its limitless possibilities.

## Design and Development  

This project features a vibrant and animated design to engage users and make the experience aesthetically pleasing. Key technologies and tools used include:  

- **Backend**: Flask framework (Python).  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript for interactivity, CSS for animations and styling.  
- **APIs**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for advanced natural language processing.  
- **Additional Features**: Integration of camera-based joint tracking for real-time data visualization.

## Challenges Faced  

Developing Four Wings was a challenging yet rewarding experience.  

1. **JavaScript Integration**:  
   Learning how to effectively use JavaScript for interactivity and API calls was a steep learning curve.  

2. **API Calls**:  
   Implementing POST requests to communicate with the OpenAI API via Flask required extensive research and debugging.  

3. **Animations and Design**:  
   Creating a visually appealing and animated interface using CSS required significant effort and attention to detail.  

Despite these challenges, the project was a valuable learning experience, deepening my understanding of Python, Flask, JavaScript, CSS, and the intricacies of API usage.

## Conclusion  

Four Wings is more than just a project; it is a testament to the power of computer science and its ability to innovate, inspire, educate, and empower. By combining creativity with technical skills, I was able to build an application that not only demonstrates the possibilities of technology but also motivates others to explore the field.  

The journey of creating Four Wings has been both challenging and transformative. It encapsulates the essence of CS50x, providing me with the tools and confidence to continue exploring and innovating in the field of computer science.

## Try It Yourself  

If you're inspired by this project, start your journey by visiting [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) and learn the skills to build your own 4 Wings.  


This is a silly little idea i had for my **Final Project for CS50X!!** 
Here i demonstrate "4 Wings":
  - **Innovation** (demontrating the usage of Computer Science for innovations like Sign Language AI Models)
  - **Wishes** (demonstrating the usage of Computer Science for making Your Wish Come True (Artificial Intelligence))
  - **Intelligence** (demonstrating the usage of Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence like Large Language AI Models)
  - **Your Turn** (Your Turn)

The point of this is to show off the different usages for Computer Science, kinda like an Etude for programming ;]
